#Overview of the analysis
V.Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

#Summary

Based on data collected during first quarter 2019, urban cities have the highest fares, rural cities have the lowest fares and suburban cities have average fares. The urban areas has approximately 30x the drivers the rural areas have and the avg fare per ride in urban areas is about $10 less than the avg fare per ride in the rural areas. The urban areas also have approximately 10x the total fares than the rural areas and 2x the total fares of the suburban areas. 

It is recommended to have an near even distribution of drivers for each city type that is proportional to the population of each city type. 
It is also recommended to take into consideration the population density of these areas and the liklihood of needing a driver. In urban areas, population density is very high and need for drivers is higher. In rural areas the population density is much lower than urban areas and more spread out, therefore the need for drivers is less as most people have their own transportation. In the event a driver is needed in rural area, it will cost more as the demand is not low. In urban areas, drivers are plentiful because of the larger population and there is a demand so the prices are much lower than the cost for the same service in a rural area where the demand is lower so the price is much higher.  
It is also recommended that alternative transportation introduced to urban and suburban areas could lower the cost of the fares.
